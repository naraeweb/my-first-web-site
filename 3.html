  Implementations of XPath 1.0 that operate on HTML documents parsed or created in the manners described in this
  specification (e.g. as part of the document.evaluate() API) must act as if the following edit was applied
  to the XPath 1.0 specification.

  First, remove this paragraph:

  A QName in the node test is expanded into an expanded-name using the namespace declarations from the expression context.
  This is the same way expansion is done for element type names in start and end-tags except that the default namespace
  declared with xmlns is not used: if the QName does not have a prefix, then the namespace URI is null
  (this is the same way attribute names are expanded). It is an error if the QName has a prefix for which there is no
  namespace declaration in the expression context.
